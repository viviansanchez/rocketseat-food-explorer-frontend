The frontend of the application is hosted on Netlify. To access it, simply
[click here.](https://boisterous-conkies-95afc5.netlify.app/)

Keep in mind that the api was deployed on a free website called [Render](https://render.com/), so it may take a while for the application to respond, and any changes you make may not persist.

## Project

This project was developed as part of my certification on the course Explorer, a Full-Stack web development course by Rocketseat. This is the Front-end of this project, and the back-end you can access on [this link](https://github.com/viviansanchez/rocketseat-food-explorer-backend)!

Food Explorer is an interactive website that simulates a restaurant menu. 

As this is a learning project and not meant for commercial use, you can access both roles through the below provided credentials. There are two users registered for each, and you can use the following credentials:

- Normal users registered:
  - user1:
    - email: user1@email.com
    - password: 123456

    -user2:
      - email: user1@email.com
      - password: 345678

- Admin users registered:
  - admin1:
    - email: admin1@email.com
    - password: 123456
  - admin2:
    - email: admin2@email.com
    - password: 123456

‚ö†Ô∏èIt is only possible to create normal users, not admin users. To access the admin interface, please use the credentials provided above.

‚ö†Ô∏èBecause the api was hosted on Render, information may not persist, and requests may take som time to resolve. For this reason, there are dishes that were pre registered and uploaded on the database, as well as the users mentioned above. 

‚ö†Ô∏èSome non-required features for qualification on the course are still in development, and I will do my best to update this project on my free time, but as I pull my attention to other projects, these features may not come to fruition. 

## Features
The following are some of the core functionalities of this app:
 - user registration
 - user authentication 
 - filter through dishes by name or by ingredient tag
 - detailed view of selected dish
 - for admin users, creation of dishes, update of selected dishe information and deletion of selected dish.
