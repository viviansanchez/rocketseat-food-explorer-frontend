# Food Explorer - Frontend

This readme will soon be updated to better explain the nature of this project and more, but for now, it's important to note that this api is hosted on a free website (https://render.com/) and therefore information may not persist.

This is why the db was uploded with some information:

- there are several dishes registered
- there are two users registered:

  - user1:

    - email: user1@email.com
    - password: 123456

  - user2:
    - email: user1@email.com
    - password: 345678

- there are two admin users registered:
  - admin1:
    - email: admin1@email.com
    - password: 123456
  - admin2:
    - email: admin2@email.com
    - password: 123456
